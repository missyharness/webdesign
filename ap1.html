            <h1>The Ethical and Economic Case for Fair Law Librarian Compensation</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>This paper argues for the ethical and economic necessity of fair compensation for law librarians within academic settings. Despite their crucial roles in research assistance, legal analysis, resource management, and even teaching, and the fact that over 85% hold both a Juris Doctor (J.D.) and a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), law librarians are often paid significantly less than law professors. This disparity is particularly problematic given the increasing complexity of legal research in the digital age, including the navigation of Large Language Models (LLMs), and the requirement for law librarians to fund their own professional development.</p>
            <p>Beyond financial inequities, law librarians frequently experience a lack of professional respect, hindering their ability to fully contribute to the academic community. Drawing upon Rawlsian theories of justice and utilitarian principles, this essay demonstrates that the undercompensation and marginalization of law librarians are not only ethically questionable but also economically inefficient, leading to low morale, high turnover, and a potential decline in the quality of legal education. By advocating for equitable compensation, recognition of their scholarly contributions, and opportunities for professional advancement, this paper contends that law schools can foster a more just, sustainable, and effective academic environment that benefits the entire legal community.</p>
