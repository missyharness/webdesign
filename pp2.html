                <p>Since living in Charleston, South Carolina, my family and I have taken up <a href="https://usapickleball.org/what-is-pickleball/" target="_blank">pickleball</a>. If you don&#39;t know what pickleball is, you are missing out. Unlike other similarly situated sports like tennis or ping pong, pickleball has a much more welcoming nature. Where these other sports can take years of practice to learn the basic level of competence, pickleball boasts a remarkably gentle learning curve. The smaller court, lower net, and slower-moving wiffle ball, make it the ideal game for all ages. The “thwack” of the paddle connecting the ball, sending it just over the net for a well-placed dink or unleashing a powerful drive down the line, provides a really thrilling and engaging activity.</p>

                <p>However, what I like most about the game is the vibrant community the game fosters, especially here in the Charleston area. You are not just engaging in a sport or activity, but you enter a social arena, where friendly competition is welcomed. I&#39;ve met people from all walks of life through pickleball—retirees seeking an active pastime, younger individuals looking for a fun way to exercise, and everyone in between. The shared enjoyment of the game goes beyond age and background, especially in an area where pickleball courts have become part of the fabric of public parks all over the Lowcountry. Don&#39;t get me wrong, you can buy the fancy equipment and go to courts that cost a lot of money per hour, but the majority of people play at the public parks.</p>
                <p>Through pickleball I have felt a tangible sense of belonging, all the while getting some much needed exercise. More than anything, I like pickleball because it has brought my family together. A game that strengthens familial ties, the community, and helps support exercise in a sedative world, makes me happy to call myself a pickleball player.</p>
