Although much rhetoric is aimed at classifying teachers as true professionals and the teaching field as a true profession, the historical, sociological, and societal means that govern the ideological foundation of a true profession are lacking in the field of education, specifically in public schools. By using a historical, sociological, philosophical, and linguistic analysis of the words "true profession", along with "unions", private teaching organizations, I am able to demonstrate not only why teaching is not a profession, but that teaching will never be a profession, even when the discourse of teachers insist that teachers are "professional". Teachers and the teaching field will continue to be classified as anything other than true professionals unless the education system as we currently know is replaced with a completely different way of viewing the job that teachers do. Therefore, I attempt to create a new classification for the field of teaching besides that of a "profession."</span></a></li>

CHAT has been employed in analysis of activities specifically within learning contexts for many years (Yamagata-Lynch, 2010). We find that the CHAT approach to the analysis of learning and learning environments is attractive because of its ability to recognise the intertwining of human thought and action (Engestr√∂m, 1987; Galperin, 1995; Leontiev, 1981).</span></a></li>

Furthering his research, in 2000, he published Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, in which Putnam attempts to explain how and why Americans&#39; social capital has consistently declined in the wake of the 1960s era. Putnam uses his main argument to demonstrate how the United States, historically recognized as a leader in democratic civic engagement, is in danger of reaching critically deficient levels of social capital, thus leading to a society that no longer trusts or knows its own members. This chapter seeks out a modern relevance for Putnam&#39;s concept of social capital in a nation increasingly defined by hyper-realism and virtual lives. In engaging some of the critiques of this particular iteration of social capital, we engage with hidden discourses of marginality and historical contextuality, the effect of dis-association and individualism on the development of communal bonds, and implications for virtual social capital. In the end, we suggest the possibility of a paradigm shift that is reflective of the faceted selves we embody today &ndash; where identities lie along a continuum from communal to virtual and technology facilitates choices about engagement and responsibility.</span></a></li>

Within countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, vexatious accountability measures, such as those provided by standardized testing, have polarized the educational arena, leaving in its wake a litany of human rights concerns. This culmination of over-testing and outcome-only driven education equates to an end game where employment and dollar signs erode the very fabric of human rights for children. In this paper, we hope to inspire understanding of the issues of contention happening in developed nations today regarding standardized testing issues, and we will make recommendations that may help these nations move from the statistical to the enlightened view of growing responsible and civic-minded citizens into the twenty-first century.</span></a></li>

Thus, the federal courts are falling further behind every year in settling disputes. The Senate&#39;s action with President Obama&#39;s nominee to the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has only escalated the dysfunction of the judicial selection process. Coupled with the fallout surrounding the death of Justice Ginsburg and Senator McConnell&#39;s complete refusal to honor the precedent set by him in 2016, it has become glaringly apparent that the confirmation process conducted by the Senate needs to be standardized and streamlined. In this article, we perform a Constitutional analysis of the actual textual role of the Senate in the Confirmation process and apply the historical interpretations of the Senate&#39;s role by the drafters of the Constitution, explaining how the judicial selection process can be updated and standardized regarding both the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts without requiring a Constitutional amendment to expedite the selection and approval of nominees and improve the efficiency of the process.</span></a></li>

In the context of today&#39;s prisons, we complicate universalist notions of citizenship by weaving theories of citizenship into the story of education. We share the daily concerns of a prison educator and explore the transformative possibilities that women convict students try on. We question how to shape educational practices in prison and contemplate the construction of a new "mock citizenship" informed by the realities of felony disenfranchisement. Our hope is to bring to the conversation something that has been lacking when discussions of incarceration occur: insight into the ways incarcerated students perform the role of citizen and how the purpose of prison education must extend beyond job readiness toward the creation of full citizens able to participate in the democratic process.</span></a></li>

This legislative effort shocked the nation with the bold move toward stricter regulations concerning the public sector, as Wisconsin is historically one of the most progressive states concerning labor within the United States. Teachers unions within the state took ACT-10 as an assault on their very profession. Shortly before the passing of the act, sit-ins and protests abounded within the capital of Madison that caught attention from both the local and national media.</p>
                    <p>To answer questions pertaining to the media, policy, government, and public sector unions, this dissertation analyzes articles from three major newspaper sources (The New York Times, The Wisconsin State Journal, and The Capital Times) from 2011-2015, utilizing both critical discourse analysis and philosophy, to examine the media's framing of the issues pertaining to public sector/teacher unions within Wisconsin. By analyzing these media sources, three data strands emerged: The Language of Battle, Neoliberalistic Discourses, and Teacher as a Defunct Agent. The three strands reveal a picture that illuminates the unions and the teacher members as the 'enemy' that is destroying the education system within the United States. All the while, the government is portrayed as the savior of the education system by passing policies that restrict the unions, eliminating their "corruption," and giving control of the education system seemingly back to the teachers and administrators. However, at the same time, the teachers' accountability and professionalism were found to also be called into question within this media framework. By portraying such a politically motivated agenda, fueled by ideas surrounding neoliberalism, the media creates social justice issues, such as hegemony, whereby they call into question the need and abilities of such organizations as unions within a highly globalized society. Per the findings of this research: what is at stake is the future of what working in America will look like with portrayals such as what can be found within the discourse presented to the public through the media.</p></span></a></li>
