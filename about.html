        <p>I am a lifelong learner with an innately intellectual curiosity. I navigate the world through a neurodivergent lens (I am on the autism spectrum. To learn more about the autism spectrum, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd">click here</a>.) This has helped and hindered me throughout my life, but it has been most profound in finding unique perspectives and insights in the everyday. My passions are deeply rooted in nurturing life, both in the quiet companionship of feline friends and the vibrant growth of my garden.</p>

        <p>Writing serves as both a creative outlet and a tool for exploration, allowing me to synthesize the knowledge I constantly seek, often sparked by new experiences encountered while exploring different cultures and landscapes during travelling, which I have a passion for. For me, kindness is not just a virtue but a guiding principle in all interactions in my life, intrinsically linked to my strong commitment to social justice. This has manifested in a passion for protecting the environment and the bodily autonomy rights of all individuals and animals alike. This commitment is something I hold fast to, and manifest in everyday experiences, like volunteering to be a foster for newborn and young kittens.</p>

        <p>While deeply engaged with complex ideas and the pursuit of understanding, I also appreciate the simple joy of discovering 'pretties' &mdash; those aesthetically pleasing objects that bring a spark of beauty to the world around me. This appreciation for beauty complements my desire to cultivate a more just and sustainable world, recognizing that both intellectual engagement and sensory delight contribute to a richer and more meaningful existence.</p>
