            <h1>Dobbs and the Double Standard: Bodily Autonomy in Abortion vs. Mandatory Vaccination</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>This paper examines the contentious issue of mandatory vaccination policies through the critical lens of bodily autonomy, particularly as it has been redefined and arguably curtailed by the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The Dobbs ruling, which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion, has significantly altered the legal landscape surrounding reproductive rights and the extent of individual control over one's body.  This analysis explores the potential implications of this shift for other areas of bodily autonomy, specifically the debate surrounding mandatory vaccinations. By contrasting the legal and ethical arguments underpinning reproductive rights with those concerning public health mandates, this paper investigates whether the reasoning in Dobbs creates a precedent for a more expansive state interest in individual bodies, potentially weakening arguments against mandatory medical interventions like vaccination. It considers the justifications for mandatory vaccination in the context of public health and communal well-being, while also scrutinizing the potential for governmental overreach and the erosion of individual liberty in a post-Dobbs legal environment. Ultimately, this paper seeks to elucidate the evolving understanding of bodily autonomy in American jurisprudence and its ramifications for future debates on healthcare mandates and individual rights.</p>
